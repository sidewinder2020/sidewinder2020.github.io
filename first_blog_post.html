        <p> So, the thing about me, I am <em>really</em> good at joking to cover up the fact that you aren't getting anywhere near the real me.  I don't necessarily think I'm a bad person, I just believe that you'll reject me the moment you find out what's under the hood.  I've spent my life in libraries, dark rooms, in general seclusion, and I understand that may shock some people, considering, if you've met me at my time in Turing, I seem to be an extremely outgoing individual.  Because of reasons I don't care to delve into, I'm outgoing only because of the belief that choosing to be isolated, and isolation brought about by events outside of your control, are two <em>very</em> different things.  The later is something I don't believe anyone should suffer.
        </p>
        <p> However, Turing has provided me with the opportunity to meet, and work with, many different types of people, most notably, through pairing.  Because of this, something happened that I wasn't expecting. I was exposed to many different sides of the same story, people, coming together to better themselves. I was astonished so many different paths could end up at the same destination.  Because of this common ground, we all accept eachother, no matter how weird, awkward, funky (not smelly though, go home and shower), insert <em>*random idiosyncracy here*</em>.  I opened up, and miraculously, no one rejected me.  You have the occasional case of personalities that don't mix, but nothing is perfect, and more importantly, everyone in the situation can identify it as just that.  I'm more myself than I've ever been, and it turns out, I like being social.

        <p> The next greatest gift, I've been given here, is the ability to code.  I've been a always been a traveler.  Something starts to bore/trap me, oh well, drop it and move on.  Forming a career was something that was completely foreign to me because as soon as the challenge was gone, so was I.  Coding is <strong>completely</strong> different. I am always challenged, sometimes to the point of breaking, but it consistently gives me attainable goals, if I'm willing to put in the work.  I have no doubt in my mind that coding is something I can build a life around.

        <p> The technical concept, that I'm most a fan of, is ...
