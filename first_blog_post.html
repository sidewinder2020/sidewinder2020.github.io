        <p> So, the thing about me, I am <em>really</em> good at joking to cover up the fact that you aren't getting anywhere near the real me.  I don't necessarily think I'm a bad person, I just believe that you'll reject me the moment you find out what's under the hood.  I've spent my life in libraries, dark rooms, in general seclusion, and I understand that may shock some people, considering, if you've met me at my time in Turing, I seem to be an extremely outgoing individual.  Because of reasons I don't care to delve into, I'm outgoing only because of the belief that choosing to be isolated, and isolation brought about by events outside of your control, are two <em>very</em> different things.  The later is something I don't believe anyone should suffer.
        </p>
        <p> Turing has provided me with the opportunity to meet, and work with, many different types of people, most notably, through pairing.  Because of this, something happened that I wasn't expecting. I was exposed to so many different sides of the same story, people, coming together to better themselves, that it astonished me so many different paths could end up at the same destination.  Because of this common ground, we all accept eachother, no matter how weird, awkward, funky (not smelly though, go home and shower), insert <em>*random idiosyncracy here*</em>
